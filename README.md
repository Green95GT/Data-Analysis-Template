# Data-Analysis-Template
Code written in C++ that reads .txt files and has a function intentionally omitted. Insert you data analysis scheme of your choice in an additional function.

These .txt files in question are users.txt, purchases.txt, and messages.txt.

The format for users.txt is as follows: 'userid','signup date'.

The format for purchases.txt is as follows: 'userid','purchase date','amount'.

The format for messages.txt is as follows: 'userid','message date','message count'.

The submitted code essentially converts the date from a year-month-day format to a numeric one on the scale of 1 - 365 (1-366 for a leap year).
